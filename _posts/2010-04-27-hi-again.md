title: Hi... again
---

Hi, I'm [Jordi Romero](/about). This is a blog, or it's supposed to be, where I can publish anything I may find useful. The subjects will vary, from programming to computer architecture, or maybe some *sysadmin* trick that took me all night to find out and want to share to make the world a better place. Time will tell.

I'm trying to have and maintain a blog since **2004**! In 6 years I never published more than 20 posts, most of which never stayed online after some months. I started blogging in Catalan, my first language. Later on 2006 I deleted the blog and replaced it with a static <acronym title="Curriculum Vitae">CV</acronym> in the front page (the first screenshot). One year later I started a *new* version of the blog (the right image) in Spanish, my second language. I published some useful Ruby on Rails tutorials, and an article about my [keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Happy_Hacking_Keyboard_Professional_2.jpg "Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2") that got some attention. Sincerely, nothing worth saving or translating to this *newer* version. Some good and interesting content is out there, and I will write it down.
