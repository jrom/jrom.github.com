### Lean Startup &amp; Science

<img width="300px" alt="Metrics for Pirates, AARRR, by Jordi Romero" src="/files/metrics-for-pirates/Title.png" />

Defining a strategy for a product startup is both exciting and hard to do
objectively. Most of the times the founders are guided by instinct and passion,
and that's great, but can lead to follow false hypothesis.

The **Lean Startup** is this whole movement and set of best
practices that can reduce uncertainty by making the founders validate their
hypothesis one after the other. It's all about validated learning, which means
applying *science* to decide if the company is going in the right
direction.

And by *science* I mean **metrics**.

### The video

This week I gave a presentation in the [Barcelona Lean Startup
Circle](http://barcelona.leanstartupcircle.com/events/100202632/) titled
**Metrics for Pirates**. [Itnig](http://itnig.net/en) was kind enough to record
and upload a video, so if you don't feel like reading you can watch it here. Not
even half an hour.

But moving on our subject, we were talking metrics...

### Actionable metrics
<img width="300px" alt="Drawing by Jordi Romero, showing an acquisition funnel generating revenue" src="/files/metrics-for-pirates/Art.png" />
The secret to make smart and fast decisions in a startup is having metrics for
everything. Actionable metrics. An **actionable metric** is one
that tells you that some relevant business indicator (revenue, I'm looking at
you) will increase by a known factor if some strengh is applied. This means that
if you have a 2.0% conversion rate and you can increase that by 20%, your
revenue will be affected proportionally. Of course there are variables that
affect this formula because the whole process is not rigid, but you get the
point.

### Customer Acquisition Funnel
Another concept to talk about before going to the actual metrics is the Customer
Acquisition Funnel. We're talking business here. And specifically we want people
to pay money for stuff. Let's call these people **customers**. I
wish there was a tree that grew customers, but as far as I know, there's no such
thing. So we have to go get them. Out in the wild.

There are many kinds of customers and many ways of finding them and converting
them into paying customers or any kind of revenue-generating users. We'll not
get dirty discussing them, though I'd love to [hear from you](/contact) if you
want to discuss any specific case.

<img width="300px" alt="Customer acquisition funnel drawing" src="/files/metrics-for-pirates/Funnel++.png" />
Here's where I say: **AARRR!** Acquisition, Activation, Retention,
Referral and Revenue. That's what you do to your customers in order to make your
business work.

I hope the image next to this paragraph is clear enough, but in case it's not:

- **Acquisition** is where you get the attention from somebody in your *customer
  segment*. Let's say you get him to visit your landing page.
- **Activation** is when you make this user not regret his visit. She likes what she
  sees. She's happy. She clicks through your links (if you know what I mean).
She signs up for a newsletter, free trial, WHATEVER.
- **Retention** is when this user shows repeated interested in your product.
  Either by coming back to your website a couple of times a month or by keep
using your free trial, opening the newsletter, reading the RSS feed, ...
- **Referral** is a little bit out of the loop, because that's when you get your
  best users (the promoters) to recommend your product to other users. This one
is a sexy one.
- **Revenue** is when you generate money out of a
  user/lead/visitor or however you call the people in your funnel. If referral
is sexy, this is getting laid.

So there's your funnel, pirate. Go make money with it. I'll warn you: this
funnel is leaky. And your job (as a CEO, founder, or whatever kids call
themselves this days) is to patch the leaks and oil the machine. You want **big
volume** at the beginning of the funnel and **high conversion** through it.

### Acquisition
Acquisition is the first step in this process. It means feeding the funnel so
you can afterwards convert these people into revenue (paying customers,
revenue-generating users, ...).

How to get people into the funnel? Ask your marketing guy. A few concepts that
should ring a bell: SEO, SEM, PR, E-mail marketing, Social Media, Affiliation
platforms...

How to **measure** each of these channels? Try to segment well and go deep in
the funnel, then measure the revenue each of them is generating. That's the best
way to set the dollars per user for each channel. Also, keep in mind that good
channel is one that can give *high volume*, *high conversion* and *low cost*.

### Activation
Once you get someone's attention, you better keep it. So create killer landing pages for a product with killer features. You
need to **make the user happy about finding you**.

How do you measure this happiness? Depends on the business, but bounce rate (or
the lack of it), visit duration, usage feature, newsletter subscription, free
trial signup, etc. are a few examples of activated users behavior. Tools like
A/B test are really valuable in this step. Don't abuse them, remember to look at
statistical significance, use it in conjunction with your common sense and do
short cycles. My favorite tool here is [Visual Website
Optimizer](http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/?partner=jrom).

Also, remember tagging your users (via
[URL](http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1033867),
via your own custom system, whatever) so you can then look *deep down in the
funnel* and see what version of the split test is working better, etc. Most of
the analytics systems that we're going to use understand Google's way of tagging
links.

### Retention
They say it's cheaper to keep a customer than to get a new one, and they both
generate the same amount of revenue. And, true story, most people often forget
to take care of their own user/customer base. How do you measure people using
your product or staying as a lead for a long period of time? Repeated visits (%
of users that come 3 times a month to your website), active usage of your
software-as-a-service, open-rate in the weekly newsletter, RSS feed view-rate,
...

If you can get your user's e-mail, **do it**! Then use some e-mail marketing
software such as [Mailchimp](http://eepurl.com/vsFlT). With Mailchimp you can
nourish a user database that you can use for your weekly/monthly newsletter but
most importantly you can setup Autoresponders that will let you automate e-mails
given user behavior patterns such as: days of inactivity (one after 3d, 7d, 1m,
...), key feature usage (or the lack of), and many other creative ways of
ensuring your users are doing what you want them to do.

If you don't get our user's e-mail, then you can try with Google AdWords
remarketing/retargeting campaigns. You should of course track all this activity
through [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) or
[KissMetrics](http://kissmetrics.com/).

### Referral
Who doesn't want their product to go viral? This is in itself a science or an
art, I'm not sure, but we're not going deep in this subject here. Maybe it
deserves its own article. Quick tips: don't try to go viral unnaturally. If your
product rocks, it will go viral organically. If your product has some kind of
virality in its nature, then try to enhance it by offering your **promoter
users** (people who would vote your product with a 9 out of 10) the right tools
to spread the word. Don't push virality tools or reward programs to just
everybody, that could go against you.
<img width="710px" alt="Referral, metrics for pirates" src="/files/metrics-for-pirates/Referral.png" />

### Revenue
You made it! Someone's willing to pay you money, or do actions that will lead to
revenue indirectly (such as: active readers in a publication that makes money
via Google AdSense or other usual suspects).

There's nothing for me to tell you about your revenue strategies or how to
measure it, because I don't know your business, but, remember, measure
everything, segment your revenue reports by user acquisition channels, user
behavior, etc. Then try to put more efforts in the best performing channels or
try to fix what's wrong with the others.

Enjoy!

### The big-ass flag
<img width="300px" alt="CEO holding a flag with metrics" src="/files/metrics-for-pirates/Flag.png" />
You see the little guy holding a big flag? She's the CEO. She has a great team of
1 to tens of people working real hard to deliver great product to a huge
customer segment with a growing market. Who doesn't.

Good news is that now she knows what business indicators (our old friends, the
**metrics**) should be following and basing her decisions on. Bad news is that
this alone is a full-time job. And as the company grows CEOs have to delegate
work and responsibility to new executives. Delegating the ownership of these
metrics is crucial. In this example I wrote possible departments that could own
each metric. Read Marketing, Product, Growth Hacker&trade; (f\*ck yeah buzzword),
Biz Dev, ...

So go build a dashboard with all these metrics and try to make all your
decisions as data-driven as you can. And if you'd like to discuss your
particular company or how does all this thing apply to it, don't hesitate and
[contact me](/about).

**Credits**: This whole pirates thing is nothing new, [Dave
McClure](http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/09/startup-metrics.html) has a
great presentation about it from back in 2007. If you're interested in the
subject, you should definitely go check him out. All the drawings from this post
are carefully done by the author, Jordi Romero, using a Montblanc pen with a
black fineliner refill, then scanned and vectorized to give it a more digital
look.
