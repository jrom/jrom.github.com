<h3>Lean Startup &amp; Science</h3>

Defining a strategy for a product startup is both exciting and hard to do
objectively. Most of the times the founders are guided by instinct and passion,
and that's great, but can lead to follow false hypothesis.

The **Lean Startup** is this whole movement and set of best
practices that can reduce uncertainty by making the founders validate their
hypothesis one after the other. It's all about validated learning, which means
applying *science* to decide if the company is going in the right
direction.

And by *science* I mean **metrics**.

<h3>Actionable metrics</h3>

The secret to make smart and fast decisions in a startup is having metrics for
everything. Actionable metrics. An **actionable metric** is one
that tells you that some relevant business indicator (revenue, I'm looking at
you) will increase by a known factor if some strengh is applied. This means that
if you have a 2.0% conversion rate and you can increase that by 20%, your
revenue will be affected proportionally. Of course there are variables that
affect this formula because the whole process is not rigid, but you get the
point.

<h3>Customer Acquisition Funnel</h3>
Another concept to talk about before going to the actual metrics is the Customer
Acquisition Funnel. We're talking business here. And specifically we want people
to pay money for stuff. Let's call these people **customers**. I
wish there was a tree that grew customers, but as far as I know, there's no such
thing. So we have to go get them. Out in the wild.

There are many kinds of customers and many ways of finding them and converting
them into paying customers or any kind of revenue-generating users. We'll not
get dirty discussing them, though I'd love to <a href="/contact">hear from
you</a> if you want to discuss any specific case.

Here's where I say: **AARRR!**. Acquisition, Activation, Retention,
Referral and Revenue. That's what you do to your customer in order to make your
business work.

I hope the image next to this paragraph is clear enough, but in case it's not:

- **Acquisition** is where you get the attention from somebody in your *customer
  segment*. Let's say you get him to visit your landing page.
- **Activation** is when you make this user not regret his visit. She likes what she
  sees. She's happy. She clicks through your links (if you know what I mean).
She signs up for a newsletter, free trial, WHATEVER.
