###Lean Startup &amp; Science
<img width="300px" alt="Metrics for Pirates, AARRR, by Jordi Romero" src="/files/metrics-for-pirates/Title.png" />

Defining a strategy for a product startup is both exciting and hard to do
objectively. Most of the times the founders are guided by instinct and passion,
and that's great, but can lead to follow false hypothesis.

The **Lean Startup** is this whole movement and set of best
practices that can reduce uncertainty by making the founders validate their
hypothesis one after the other. It's all about validated learning, which means
applying *science* to decide if the company is going in the right
direction.

And by *science* I mean **metrics**.

### Actionable metrics
<img width="300px" alt="Drawing by Jordi Romero, showing an acquisition funnel generating revenue" src="/files/metrics-for-pirates/Art.png" />
The secret to make smart and fast decisions in a startup is having metrics for
everything. Actionable metrics. An **actionable metric** is one
that tells you that some relevant business indicator (revenue, I'm looking at
you) will increase by a known factor if some strengh is applied. This means that
if you have a 2.0% conversion rate and you can increase that by 20%, your
revenue will be affected proportionally. Of course there are variables that
affect this formula because the whole process is not rigid, but you get the
point.

### Customer Acquisition Funnel
Another concept to talk about before going to the actual metrics is the Customer
Acquisition Funnel. We're talking business here. And specifically we want people
to pay money for stuff. Let's call these people **customers**. I
wish there was a tree that grew customers, but as far as I know, there's no such
thing. So we have to go get them. Out in the wild.

There are many kinds of customers and many ways of finding them and converting
them into paying customers or any kind of revenue-generating users. We'll not
get dirty discussing them, though I'd love to [hear from you](/contact) if you
want to discuss any specific case.

<img width="300px" alt="Customer acquisition funnel drawing" src="/files/metrics-for-pirates/Funnel++.png" />
Here's where I say: **AARRR!** Acquisition, Activation, Retention,
Referral and Revenue. That's what you do to your customers in order to make your
business work.

I hope the image next to this paragraph is clear enough, but in case it's not:

- **Acquisition** is where you get the attention from somebody in your *customer
  segment*. Let's say you get him to visit your landing page.
- **Activation** is when you make this user not regret his visit. She likes what she
  sees. She's happy. She clicks through your links (if you know what I mean).
She signs up for a newsletter, free trial, WHATEVER.
- **Retention** is when this user shows repeated interested in your product.
  Either by coming back to your website a couple of times a month or by keep
using your free trial, opening the newsletter, reading the RSS feed, ...
- **Referral** is a little bit out of the loop, because that's when you get your
  best users (the promoters) to recommend your product to other users. This one
is a sexy one.
- **Revenue** is when you generate money out of a
  user/lead/visitor or however you call the people in your funnel. If referral
is sexy, this is getting laid.

So there's your funnel, pirate. Go make money with it. I'll warn you: this
funnel is leaky. And your job (as a CEO, founder, or whatever kids call
themselves this days) is to patch the leaks and oil the machine. You want **big
volume** at the beginning of the funnel and **high conversion** through it.

### Activation

### Retention

### Referral

### Revenue

### The big-ass flag
<img width="300px" alt="CEO holding a flag with metrics" src="/files/metrics-for-pirates/Flag.png" />
You see the little guy holding a big flag? She's the CEO. She has a great team of
1 to tens of people working real hard to deliver great product to a huge
customer segment with a growing market. Who doesn't.

Good news is that now she knows what business indicators (our old friends, the
**metrics**) should be following and basing her decisions on. Bad news is that
this alone is a full-time job. And as the company grows CEOs have to delegate
work and responsibility to new executives. Delegating the ownership of these
metrics is crucial. In this example I wrote possible departments that could own
each metric. Read Marketing, Product, Growth Hacker&trade; (f\*ck yeah buzzword),
Biz Dev, ...

So go build a dashboard with all these metrics and try to make all your
decisions as data-driven as you can. And if you'd like to discuss your
particular company or how does all this thing apply to it, don't hesitate and
[contact me](/about).

**Credits**: This whole pirates thing is nothing new, [Dave
McClure](http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/09/startup-metrics.html) has a
great presentation about it from back in 2007. If you're interested in the
subject, you should definitely go check him out. All the drawings from this post
are carefully done by the author, Jordi Romero, using a Montblanc pen with a
black fineliner refill, then scanned and vectorized to give it a more digital
look.
