This is the description (and slides) from the talk I gave at the
[toster.ru](http://toster.ru/) conference in Moscow.

The main point of the talk is to go through every major design decision
around API design, so both API producers and consumers know what to
offer or expect from a well designed <strong>REST API</strong>.

REST APIs are essential in any modern web application. It's currently a
trend not to build <em>Web Apps</em> but <em>Platforms</em>. A good REST
API is the core of the platform, where web apps, mobile apps, 3rd party
integrations, etc. can just use as its brain.

Some of the concepts the talk goes around are: HTTP, REST, URI,
metadata, representations, security, versioning, pagination. These are
all relevant aspects of a good REST API design. After that, some tips
about <strong>implementation</strong> and <strong>deployment</strong>
are thrown to the mix. Finally, <strong>scaling</strong> is mentioned as
a key challenge a successful API will find. Horizontal scaling, HTTP
cache, application cache, database replication and asynchrony are
mentioned as possible methods to help the scaling of an API, although
the design will still carry most of the responsability to decide if an
API can scale easily or not.
