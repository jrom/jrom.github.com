Yesterday [@masylum](https://twitter.com/#!/masylum) showed me [watbutton.com](http://watbutton.com/) and after playing with it for 2 minutes we couldn't help it:
We needed [Gary Bernhardt](http://twitter.com/#!/garybernhardt)'s [WATs](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) in our development tools ASAP. *Read: Replace the Terminal bell with a WAT*.

Imagine hearing Gary's *voice* each time you hit an extra key by mistake. I no longer hit `<Esc>` more than once to exit insert mode in vim, because the second time I'd have Gary asking me: WAT? *What the fuck are you doing hitting escape again if you're already in normal mode?* This was the path to perfect typing.

Now, if you also want Gary's WATs in your Mac:

1. Grab your favorite WAT.
  Three of them are available at [watbutton.com](http://watbutton.com/) (look at the source). The one I like more is [this one](http://watbutton.com/wat1.mp3).

2. Convert it to a compatible AIF file.
  Follow [these steps](http://www.mymacosx.com/snow-leopard/custom-alert-sounds-mac-os-leopard.html) or just **save you some time and use [mine](/files/wat-driven-development/wat.aif)**.

3. Copy the file to `~/Library/Sounds`

4. Select it in your **System Preferences &raquo; Sound**

5. Make sure you have your bell enabled in your terminal app. Most people disable it because they don't master the art of precise typing, but this was before they knew about WAT Driven Development.

PS: My only contribution to WAT Driven Development was putting things together. [Gary Bernhardt](https://twitter.com/#!/garybernhardt) is an awesome dude who makes a living with his [advanced programming screencasts](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/) and his WATs traveled around the interwebs thanks to his [lightning talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat).
[Noah Kantrowitz](https://twitter.com/#!/kantrn) did [watbutton.com](http://watbutton.com/). [Pau Ramon](https://twitter.com/#!/masylum) showed it to me and got me excited to do the actual thing. He blogs [here](http://pau.calepin.co/).
