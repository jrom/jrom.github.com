SEO is sometimes considered some kind of black smoke by us, The Engineers&reg;.

I guess the *problem* is that most of the time, the people that worry about SEO
are the marketers, and the hackers of the world don't mix well with them. Sometimes.

This is why I try to learn about everything related to the web, even black
smoke like SEO. Everything I learn and I think is useful for my peers, I'll
find some time and write about it here.
