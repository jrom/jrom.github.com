Ruby is an awesome programming language. I happen to use it *a lot*, both in [my job](http://jrdv.org) and just [for fun](http://github.com/jrom).

Most of the time I'm not going to write about Ruby itself, but about Ruby related stuff, meaning Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and others. The Rails world is very healthy and verbose, but Rails evolves so fast, the documentation often becomes deprecated. That's why I think it's always handy to have some fresh writing about that.
