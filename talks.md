I always enjoyed teaching stuff to people. Unfortunately the blog format
doesn't really work with my schedule, so I found myself being able to
prepare long and well thought talks instead of actually blogging about
it. As I keep doing that, I'll make sure to at least blog a brief talk
description together with the slides so they are reachable.
